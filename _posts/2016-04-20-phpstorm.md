There has been lots of buzz about many of the new features in PHP 5.4, like the traits support, the
short array syntax and all those other syntax improvements.

But one set of changes that I think is particularly important was largely overlooked: For PHP 5.4
cataphract ([Artefacto][1] on StackOverflow) heroically rewrote large parts of `htmlspecialchars`
thus fixing various quirks and adding some really nice new features.

(The changes discussed here apply not only to [`htmlspecialchars`][2], but also to the related
[`htmlentities`][3] and in parts to [`htmlspecialchars_decode`][4], [`html_entity_decode`][5] and
[`get_html_translation_table`][6].)

Here a quick summary of the most important changes:

 * UTF-8 as the default charset
 * Improved error handling (`ENT_SUBSTITUTE`)
 * Doctype handling (`ENT_HTML401`, ...)

UTF-8 as the default charset

{% highlight php startinline %}
htmlspecialchars("<\x80The End\xef\xbf\xbf>", ENT_QUOTES | ENT_HTML5 | ENT_DISALLOWED | ENT_SUBSTITUTE, 'UTF-8');
