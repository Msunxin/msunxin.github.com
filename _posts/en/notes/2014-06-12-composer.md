## Notes about composer

 - Set COMPOSER_HOME env variable before installing global libs, for instance phpunit
 - We can set COMPOSER_HOME environment variable by specifing settings in composer.json for projects
 - The path of global configuration file is config.json rather than composer.json,which located at COMPOSER_HOME

{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "config":{
        "home" : "path/to/composer/home"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
